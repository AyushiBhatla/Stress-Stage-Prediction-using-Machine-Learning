# Stress-Stage-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts an individual's Stress Stage (Low, Moderate, High) using Machine Learning techniques based on features like mental health scores, lifestyle habits, and demographic information.  The project leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to build a robust stress classification system.
